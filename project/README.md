How it Works

Button one:
- It plays a small piece of song that advances by clicking the button multiple
times

Button two:
- Led's blink creating a pattern
 
Button Three:
- Stops any of the actions being executed

Button Four:
- Plays another song that also advances by clicking the button multiple times

Each button can be played right after the other.
